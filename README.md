## About This Repository
This repository contains all the **activities** and **laboratory exercises** for the course **IT 314 - Web Systems and Technologies**. Each activity showcases practical applications of the concepts taught in the course, focusing on modern web development tools, frameworks, and technologies.

## Learning the following topics will greatly help you on your journey as you pursue software development or engineering. I used to skip some fundamentals, but these activities helped me learn and understand how to use them effectively.

Before diving into these activities, we focused on applying semantic layout to every exercise. Semantic layout in web design is crucial because it provides a clear structure to your website's content. This makes it easier for users to navigate, understand the information hierarchy, and for search engines to interpret the page. Ultimately, this leads to a better user experience and improved SEO rankings.

## Laboratory Activity 1 - Tables
Tables are incredibly useful, and trust me, you’ll find them essential as you work on future projects, capstones, or even your thesis. Whether it’s for admin management, listing items or stocks, schedules, or many other purposes, mastering tables will always come in handy.

## Laboratory Activity 2 - Vision Board
In this activity, we built a vision board using external CSS and applied Flexbox. Hear me out—Flexbox is a game-changer! Once you learn how to properly align elements, position them, and wrap content to make your design responsive, building websites becomes much more enjoyable. You’ll start to rely less on media queries and write cleaner, more efficient code.

## Laboratory Activity 3 - Word Counter
Without logic, your website might seem lifeless. In this activity, we introduced JavaScript to add interactivity. We built a word counter—a tool I once searched for online to count my essay’s word count, but this time we created it ourselves. This activity taught us how to use string and array methods, along with functions, to solve real-world problems.

## Laboratory Activity 4 - Personal Page
This activity brought everything together—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From knowing nothing about building web applications to creating a functional personal page, this project laid the foundation for tackling more complex projects in the future.
